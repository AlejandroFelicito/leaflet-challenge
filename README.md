3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **Leaflet-Part-1** and **Leaflet-Part-2**.
4. This Challenge uses both **HTML** and **JavaScript**, so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.
5. Push the above changes to GitHub.
